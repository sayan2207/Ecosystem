        Asurion is best known for offering smartphone insurance plans and support
        through several major mobile carriers. My goal for this project was to improve the emotional state
        of our customers as they move through the process of filing an insurance claim.</p>

      <p>Environmental data collected worldwide points to one obvious fact: the conditions are going to change drastically over the next 50 - 100 years. Our world today is plagued by a variety of environmental imbalances caused by the harmful activities of humans. Issues like global warming, gradual rising of sea levels, climatic changes, extinction of animals are wreaking havoc. Going by the saying, change is the only aspect of life that is constant, our ability to adapt to change will be thoroughly tested, failing to do so will lead to human extinction.</p>
      <p>A system that could approximately figure out the generic trend of the traits in species given an ecosystem will not only help us study the future forms of the currently existing species but also help us distinguish rather endangered organisms among the rest. This however cannot be achieved using a single mathematical formula, rather a simulation of the organisms and their interdependence among one another and their surroundings over a period of time can help us arrive at a similar goal.</p>
