                <p><b>Environmental data collected worldwide points to one obvious fact: the conditions are going to change drastically over the next 50 - 100 years.</b> Our world today is plagued by a variety of environmental imbalances caused by the harmful activities of humans. Issues like global warming, gradual rising of sea levels, climatic changes, extinction of animals are wreaking havoc. Going by the saying, <b>change is the only aspect of life which is constant</b>, our ability to adapt to change will be thoroughly tested, failing to do so will lead to human extinction.</p>
                <p>In this work, the <b>user plays the role of God</b>. This toolkit helps the user mimic a real-world ecosystem where he can introduce new organisms with custom characteristics and also bring changes to the ecosystem and then observe their behavior and reaction to those changes. Thus the user can be looked upon as The God of the ecosystem who has the power to bring any change with which he can simulate the problems happening worldwide and gain valuable insights on how the organisms try to adapt to the change to ensure their survival. Studying the overall behavior of the ecosystem will provide us with a wealth of knowledge and be far better prepared for how we should be equipped to handle the future.</p>
